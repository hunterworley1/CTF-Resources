# Intro to CTF's
A CTF (Capture the Flag) is a competetion featuring challenges having to do with cybersecurity/information-security. Typically CTF's include a wide array of challenges including Cryptography, Forensics, Web, Reverse Engineering, and PWN. While every CTF is differnt, they are usually presented in a "Jeopardy" format, where challenges are separated by category and are worth varying point amounts. </br>
## Why do CTF's?
CTF's typically model challenges on real life security problems. Participating in CTF's can help expose you to these problems and aid you in recognizing them in the future. CTF's also help you to practice the skills you have learned in a safe and controlled enviornment. CTF's can also provide you with a way to garner security experience prior to getting a security job. Last but not least, CTF's are generally a lot of fun! </br>
## Get Involved
We would love to have more people on our CTF teams! If you are interested make sure you check out the CTF channel in discord for when the next CTF is. Typically all you need to do to sign up is make an account on the CTF platform. Getting involved can mean something as simple as collaborating with us in the chat for a few minutes as we solve a challenge. Another great way to get started is to attempt to solve already solved challenges. While you may not recieve points for solving it, you can use it as a learning experience.  </br>
## Feeling Unsure?
While there are a few of us CTF-fanatics that dedicate a whole weekend to doing a CTF, we do not expect that from anyone else. We also do not expect anyone to know everything about every topic. There will often be times when we are faced with a topic we have never heard of before. That is where collaboration is key! We work together to identify the problem and solution. Sometimes it even requires the whole team! The main point is that you are trying and want to learn, we ask no more than that! If you are still unsure or have questions message me (inducedpower) on discord. I am always happy to talk CTF's.
## Virtual Machines
Sometimes CTF's involve downloading an array of files and handling/running sketchy software. While they are usually not too malicious, it is still important to handle these files in a security concious way. A VM is vital in CTF's as they can provide a layer of protection to your host system. This can also help to keep your main file system clean during the CTF. Typically these challenges are solved with a Kali Linux box (https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-virtualbox-guest-vm/). Sometimes challenges can also require a Windows machine (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53TH0LSzTzg). </br>
## Helpful things to know
Python - Python is the main scripting language used when solving challenges. Scripts can have a wide array of uses from breaking cryptography to interacting with web servivces. </br>
</br>
Code Logic - Often times you are given a file and are required to determine what the file does. This sometimes means reading source code from a variety of languages. </br>
</br>
Linux - Knowing how to navigate a Linux enviornment and run tools from the command line is vital in CTF's as many challenges use a CLI. </br>

## Resources
This repository contains a tool list of tools that are used in almost all CTF's. In the future this repository will have pages with information regarding various CTF topics.
