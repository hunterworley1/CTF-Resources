# Introduction
## Challenge Types
Almost every CTF involves challenges from the following categories
<ul>
    <li>Web</li>
    <li>OSINT</li>
    <li>Forensics</li>
    <li>Reversing</li>
    <li>pwn(Binary Exploitation)</li>
    <li>Cryptograhpy</li>
    <li>Misc</li>
</ul> 

## Virtual Machines
Sometimes CTF's involve downloading an array of files and handling/running various software. While they are usually not malicious (some CTF's have involved live malware), it is still important to handle these files in a security concious way. A VM is vital in CTF's as they can provide a layer of protection to your host system. This can also help to keep your main file system clean during the CTF. Typically these challenges are solved with a Kali Linux box (https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-virtualbox-guest-vm/). Sometimes challenges can also require a Windows machine (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53TH0LSzTzg). </br>
## Helpful things to know
<b>Python</b> - Python is the main scripting language used when solving challenges. Scripts can have a wide array of uses from breaking cryptography to interacting with web servivces. </br>

<b>Code Logic</b> - Often times you are given a file and are required to determine what the file does. This sometimes means reading source code from a variety of languages. </br>

<b>Linux</b> - Knowing how to navigate a Linux enviornment and run tools from the command line is vital in CTF's as many challenges use a CLI. </br>

<b>Google</b> - Knowing how to look things up is crucial! Oftentimes challenges involve unfamiliar concepts, know not only how to find the information but also verify it. </br>
